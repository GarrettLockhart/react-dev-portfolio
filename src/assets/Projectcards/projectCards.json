It's too slow. Your computer lags. There isn't enough space to download the game. Even if you know what components your computer comes with, who's to say if it's newer or older than the recommended minimum? That is where Unplayable comes in.Unplayable is an application that will cross reference your computer's components with Steam's recommended minimum to play their games. You'll be given statistics on whether the game you're looking at will run well, passably, or if it's not recommended on the device in question.",
